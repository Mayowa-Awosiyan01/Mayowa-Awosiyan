# Mayowa Awosiyan's Portfolio

Hello this is my portfolio to show off my projects, skills, and interests. It is still currently a work in porgress as I continue to update it. Feel free to fork this project if you wish or if you just want to visit the live version of the website click [here](https://mayowa-awosiyan.vercel.app/).

### Tech Stack

---

I am building this portfolio with Next.JS so my frontend consists of Next.JS, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and TailwindCSS. A recent update added the feedback component which is using a SQL table hosted by Supabase to store responses and when the comment was submitted.

The Matrix themed animated background of the website was made using the tsParticles library which is a JavaScript library that helps create animated backgrounds for websites and even supports interactivity. To learn more about it you can visit their [website](https://particles.js.org/). Maybe one day I'll finally watch the second and third Matrix movies.

### Recent Updates

---

The most recent updates to the website changed my resume to a more recent version that better explains my skills and what I did in my previous roles. The big change of the recent update however is that projects are now on the main page and what used to be the project page has been deleted.

### Future Updates

---

After a long hiatus I finally updated the projects page. Now what I want to do is add a full screen welcoming section hopefully with some animation that looks like my name is being typed out. In the future I may add another textbox for an email address so that people who want a response can leave a way to contact them back but for now I will be leaving it at a one way communication style.

Further down the line I would like to also add a way for visiters to change the animated background away from the Matrix themed one it is set too currently because while trying to set up the falling binary values I came across several different configurations I found very appealing. Those config files can be found next to the binaryConfig.js file in the app/config folder. This would also allow me to use the interactive elements of the lobrary more and from my testing you can do alot of cool things with it. Also I want to add styling for suporting smaller screens like mobile devices because currently the styling is mostly assuming visitors will be on desktop, which has held true so far but I still think it is important to add support for mobile devices.
