# Mayowa Awosiyan's Portfolio

Hello this is my portfolio to show off my projects, skills, and interests. It is still currently a work in porgress as I continue to update it. If you want to visit the live version of the website click [here](https://mayowa-awosiyan.vercel.app/).

### Tech Stack

---

I am building this portfolio with Next.js so my frontend consists of Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and TailwindCSS. The feedback component is using a SQL table hosted by Supabase to store responses and when the comment was submitted.

The Matrix themed animated background of the website was made using the tsParticles library which is a JavaScript library that helps create animated backgrounds for websites and even supports interactivity. To learn more about it you can visit their [website](https://particles.js.org/). Maybe one day I'll finally watch the second and third Matrix movies.

### Recent Updates

---

I no longer enjoy how this portfolio looks so I will be changing basically everything about it.

### Future Updates

---

I have a welcome section now featuring a simple animation of the button bouncing. I will probably come back to this to also add an animation for welcome being typed out. In the future I may add another textbox for an email address so that people who want a response can leave a way to contact them back but for now I will be leaving it at a one way communication style. I also want to look into keeping track of what people interact with on the site but that might require a paid subscription for Vercel and I will not be doing that.

I want to add something for the skills section to make it more interactive but that might not be used by recruiters viewing the site for all of 15 seconds before looking at the next application. It would be cool and good practice so I might do it anyway.

Further down the line I would like to also add a way for visiters to change the animated background away from the Matrix themed one it is set too currently because while trying to set up the falling binary values I came across several different configurations I found very appealing. Those config files can be found next to the binaryConfig.js file in the app/config folder. This would also allow me to use the interactive elements of the lobrary more and from my testing you can do alot of cool things with it. Also I want to add styling for suporting smaller screens like mobile devices because currently the styling is mostly assuming visitors will be on desktop, which has held true so far but I still think it is important to add support for mobile devices.
