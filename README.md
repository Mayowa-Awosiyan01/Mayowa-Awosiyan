# Mayowa Awosiyan's Portfolio

Hello this is my portfolio to show off my projects, skills, and interests. It is still currently a work in porgress as I continue to update it. Feel free to fork this project if you wish or if you just want to visit the live version of the website click [here](https://mayowa-awosiyan.vercel.app/).

### Tech Stack

---

I am building this portfolio with Next.JS so my frontend consists of Next.JS, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and TailwindCSS. Currently the project does not have a backend since no features that require one have been implemented yet. Please see the future updates section below for more details.

The Matrix themed animated background of the website was made using the tsParticles library which is a JavaScript library that helps create animated backgrounds for websites and even supports interactivity. To learn more about it you can visit their [website](https://particles.js.org/). Maybe one day I'll finally watch the second and third Matrix movies.

### Recent Updates

---

The most recent update to the website made it so that the resume button in the navbar finally works by opening my resume in a new tab.

### Future Updates

---

The next planned update to the website will be minor additions to the skills on the homepapge and its layout. After that I want to add a backend to this project to be used for a contact me page that would allow visitors to directly send me messages about the website or my projects. I will probably be using either Firebase or Supabase for that.

Further down the line I would like to also add a way for visiters to change the animated background away from the Matrix themed one it is set too currently because while trying to set up the falling binary values I came across several different configurations I found very appealing. Those config files can be found next to the binaryConfig.js file in the app/config folder. This would also allow me to use the interactive elements of the lobrary more and from my testing you can do alot of cool things with it.
